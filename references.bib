	title = {The {PR2} {Workshop}-{Mobile} {Manipulation} of {Kitchen} {Containers}},
	abstract = {In this work we report about our efforts to equip service robots with the ability to robustly operate articulated containers such as refrigerators and drawers in kitchen environments. We identified three important aspects for such systems: (1) the ability to detect fixtures on an articulated object, (2) to robustly open and close them and (3) to store and retrieve information about these objects in the map. In particular, we detect grasping fixtures such as handles and knobs in 3D point clouds using a RANSAC-based plane detection and subsequent clustering approach. Further, we developed two types of controllers to operate articulated objects: the first controller is model-free and incrementally opens articulated models. The second controller is model-based and estimates both the kinematic structure and the kinematic parameters. Finally, we store the inferred articulation models into our knowledge processing system KnowRob readily available for later interactions. All software components have been tested on two PR2 (Personal Robot 2) robots located at TUM and Bosch and are freely available on ros.org.},

	abstract = {We create a unified framework for analyzing and synthesizing plans  with loops for solving problems with non-deterministic numeric  effects and a limited form of partial observability.  Three  different action models---with deterministic, qualitative  non-deterministic and Boolean non-deterministic semantics---are  handled using a single abstract representation.  We establish the  conditions under which the correctness and termination of solutions,  represented as abstract policies, can be verified.  We also examine  the feasibility of learning abstract policies from examples.  We  demonstrate our techniques on several planning problems and show  that they apply to challenging real-world tasks such as doing the  laundry with a PR2 robot.  These results resolve a number of open  questions about planning with loops and facilitate the development  of new algorithms and applications.},

We argue that technology, design and user experience have to match to create a robot that will blend not only visually, but also emotionally into the scenarios it will be used for. We describe the requirement priorities, design decisions and technical feasibility with which Care-O-bot 4 is able to fulfill tasks in human environments and additionally evokes positive emotions and thus furthering and enhancing human-robot interaction (HRI)},
