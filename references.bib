	abstract = {A Behavior Tree (BT) is a way to structure the switching between different tasks in an autonomous agent, such as a robot or a virtual entity in a computer game. BTs are a very efficient way of creating complex systems that are both modular and reactive. These properties are crucial in many applications, which has led to the spread of BT from computer game programming to many branches of AI and Robotics. In this book, we will first give an introduction to BTs, then we describe how BTs relate to, and in many cases generalize, earlier switching structures. These ideas are then used as a foundation for a set of efficient and easy to use design principles. Properties such as safety, robustness, and efficiency are important for an autonomous system, and we describe a set of tools for formally analyzing these using a state space description of BTs. With the new analysis tools, we can formalize the descriptions of how BTs generalize earlier approaches. We also show the use of BTs in automated planning and machine learning. Finally, we describe an extended set of tools to capture the behavior of Stochastic BTs, where the outcomes of actions are described by probabilities. These tools enable the computation of both success probabilities and time to completion.},

	abstract = {Developments in mobile robot navigation have enabled robots to operate in warehouses, retail stores, and on sidewalks around pedestrians. Various navigation solutions have been proposed, though few as widely adopted as ROS Navigation. 10 years on, it is still one of the most popular navigation solutions. Yet, ROS Navigation has failed to keep up with modern trends. We propose the new navigation solution, Navigation2, which builds on the successful legacy of ROS Navigation. Navigation2 uses a behavior tree for navigator task orchestration and employs new methods designed for dynamic environments applicable to a wider variety of modern sensors. It is built on top of ROS2, a secure message passing framework suitable for safety critical applications and program lifecycle management. We present experiments in a campus setting utilizing Navigation2 to operate safely alongside students over a marathon as an extension of the experiment proposed in Eppstein et al. The Navigation2 system is freely available at https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2 with a rich community and instructions.},

	abstract = {The next chapter of the robotics revolution is well underway with the deployment of robots for a broad range of commercial use cases. Even in a myriad of applications and environments, there exists a common vocabulary of components that robots share—the need for a modular, scalable, and reliable architecture; sensing; planning; mobility; and autonomy. The Robot Operating System (ROS) was an integral part of the last chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely available components and a modular framework. However, ROS 1 was not designed with many necessary production-grade features and algorithms. ROS 2 and its related projects have been redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at all scales. In this Review, we highlight the philosophical and architectural changes of ROS 2 powering this new chapter in the robotics revolution. We also show through case studies the influence ROS 2 and its adoption has had on accelerating real robot systems to reliable deployment in an assortment of challenging environments.

            This Review describes ROS 2’s design, features, and performance with four case studies on land, air, sea, and even space.},

	abstract = {In this work we report about our efforts to equip service robots with the ability to robustly operate articulated containers such as refrigerators and drawers in kitchen environments. We identified three important aspects for such systems: (1) the ability to detect fixtures on an articulated object, (2) to robustly open and close them and (3) to store and retrieve information about these objects in the map. In particular, we detect grasping fixtures such as handles and knobs in 3D point clouds using a RANSAC-based plane detection and subsequent clustering approach. Further, we developed two types of controllers to operate articulated objects: the first controller is model-free and incrementally opens articulated models. The second controller is model-based and estimates both the kinematic structure and the kinematic parameters. Finally, we store the inferred articulation models into our knowledge processing system KnowRob readily available for later interactions. All software components have been tested on two PR2 (Personal Robot 2) robots located at TUM and Bosch and are freely available on ros.org.},

We establish the  conditions under which the correctness and termination of solutions,  represented as abstract policies, can be verified.  We also examine  the feasibility of learning abstract policies from examples.  We  demonstrate our techniques on several planning problems and show  that they apply to challenging real-world tasks such as doing the  laundry with a PR2 robot.
