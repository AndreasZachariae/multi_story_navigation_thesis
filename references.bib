	doi = {10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564514},
	abstract = {Real-time autonomous navigation and scheduling are regarded as the prerequisite capabilities for indoor mobile robots, while the application of prior information about the indoor map can contribute to reducing the level of computational complexity significantly. The indoor maps can be generated through manual marking or using automatic generation methods. The latter considerably reduces human intervention, which makes it more suitable for large indoor environments. However, most of the existing approaches to the automatic generation of indoor maps suffer such problems as imprecision and the lack of smoothness. These issues impede the generated map from meeting the requirement for safety and traceability. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a novel approach to the automatic generation of the indoor hierarchical topological map (HTM) based on the straight skeleton. This method involves three steps. Firstly, the boundaries of walls and obstacles are extracted from the grid map or the CAD drawing. Secondly, the extracted boundaries are used to automatically generate the primary tracks in narrow corridors, the regions in large open areas, and the secondary tracks within these regions. Thirdly, for the robots that are incapable of taking a spin turn, the clothoid-based smoothing method is applied to ensure the curvature continuity of generated tracks. According to the experimental results, the proposed method is accurate in describing the topological structure of complex and changeable indoor environments and effective in providing smooth and easy-to-track trajectories.},

	doi = {10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570793},
	abstract = {Autonomous place detection has long been a major hurdle to topological map-building techniques. Theoretical work on topological mapping has assumed that places can be reliably detected by a robot, resulting in deterministic actions. Whether or not deterministic place detection is always achievable is controversial; however, even topological mapping algorithms that assume non-determinism benefit from highly reliable place detection. Unfortunately, topological map-building implementations often have hand-coded place detection algorithms that are brittle and domain dependent. This paper presents an algorithm for reliable autonomous place detection that is sensor and domain independent. A preliminary implementation of this algorithm for an indoor robot has demonstrated reliable place detection in real-world environments, with no a priori environmental knowledge. The implementation uses a local, scrolling 2D occupancy grid and a real-time calculated Voronoi graph to find the skeleton of the free space in the local surround. In order to utilize the place detection algorithm in non-corridor environments, we also introduce the extended Voronoi graph (EVG), which seamlessly transitions from a skeleton of a midline in corridors to a skeleton that follows walls in rooms larger than the local scrolling map.},

A navigation stack which enables use of the proposed approach for navigation in a multi-floor building and enables multi-robot operations has been detailed. The improvements provided by the proposed navigation stack over the existing ROS (Robot Operating System) navigation stack have been explained. A way to integrate multiple local path-execution nodes which can combine together to execute the planned global path has also been explained. The paper also demonstrates the reuse of existing ROS compliant source codes for implementation of the proposed navigation stack, thereby optimizing the use of proven and established technology. Further, the extensions to different components of the existing ROS navigation stack, definition of new ROS messages and action definitions, to enable interaction between the components of the stack has been explained. The paper concludes with a brief study on how the proposed stack can be used for multi-robot operations.},

	abstract = {An efficient, hierarchical, two-dimensional (2D) path-planning method for large complex environments is presented in this paper. For mobile robots moving in 2D environments, conventional path-planning algorithms employ single-layered maps; the proposed approach engages in hierarchical inter- and intra-regional searches. A navigable graph of an environment is constructed using segmented local grid maps and safe junction nodes. An inter-regional path is obtained using the navigable graph and a graph-search algorithm. A skeletonization-informed rapidly exploring random tree* (SIRRT*) efficiently computes converged intra-regional paths for each map segment. The sampling process of the proposed hierarchical path-planning algorithm is locally conducted only in the start and goal regions, whereas the conventional path-planning should process the sampling over the entire environment. The entire path from the start position to the goal position can be achieved more quickly and more robustly using the hierarchical approach than the conventional single-layered method. The performance of the hierarchical path-planning is analyzed using a publicly available benchmark environment.},

Edge detection algorithm includes function edge and marker-controlled watershed segmentation. It features the simple algorithm implemented in MATLAB. The watershed segmentation has been proved to be a powerful and fast technique for both contour detection and region-based segmentation. In principle, watershed segmentation depends on ridges to perform a proper segmentation, a property that is often fulfilled in contour detection where the boundaries of the objects are expressed as ridges. For region-based segmentation, it is possible to convert the edges of the objects into ridges by calculating an edge map of the image. Watershed is normally implemented by region growing, based on a set of markers to avoid oversegmentation.},

Unlike the original HD* algorithm, the FHD* algorithm guarantees the optimality of the global path, and requires considerably less time for the path replanning operations. This is achieved by several modifications: (1) optimal placement of the so-called bridge nodes needed for hierarchy creation, (2) focusing the search around the optimal path, which reduces the search area without loss of optimality, and (3) introduction of partial starts and partial goals, which further reduce computational time of replanning operations. The FHD* algorithm was tested in a multi-room indoor environment and compared with the original HD* algorithm, non-hierarchical D* algorithm, and Focussed D* algorithm under the same conditions. The FHD* algorithm significantly outperforms other algorithms with respect to the computational time. Furthermore, it can be easily extended to the problem of path planning between different floors or buildings.},

BTs are a very efficient way of creating complex systems that are both modular and reactive. These properties are crucial in many applications, which has led to the spread of BT from computer game programming to many branches of AI and Robotics. In this book, we will first give an introduction to BTs, then we describe how BTs relate to, and in many cases generalize, earlier switching structures. These ideas are then used as a foundation for a set of efficient and easy to use design principles. Properties such as safety, robustness, and efficiency are important for an autonomous system, and we describe a set of tools for formally analyzing these using a state space description of BTs. With the new analysis tools, we can formalize the descriptions of how BTs generalize earlier approaches. We also show the use of BTs in automated planning and machine learning. Finally, we describe an extended set of tools to capture the behavior of Stochastic BTs, where the outcomes of actions are described by probabilities. These tools enable the computation of both success probabilities and time to completion.},

Even in a myriad of applications and environments, there exists a common vocabulary of components that robots shareâthe need for a modular, scalable, and reliable architecture; sensing; planning; mobility; and autonomy. The Robot Operating System (ROS) was an integral part of the last chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely available components and a modular framework. However, ROS 1 was not designed with many necessary production-grade features and algorithms. ROS 2 and its related projects have been redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at all scales. In this Review, we highlight the philosophical and architectural changes of ROS 2 powering this new chapter in the robotics revolution. We also show through case studies the influence ROS 2 and its adoption has had on accelerating real robot systems to reliable deployment in an assortment of challenging environments.

	title = {The {PR2} {Workshop}-{Mobile} {Manipulation} of {Kitchen} {Containers}},
	abstract = {In this work we report about our efforts to equip service robots with the ability to robustly operate articulated containers such as refrigerators and drawers in kitchen environments. We identified three important aspects for such systems: (1) the ability to detect fixtures on an articulated object, (2) to robustly open and close them and (3) to store and retrieve information about these objects in the map. In particular, we detect grasping fixtures such as handles and knobs in 3D point clouds using a RANSAC-based plane detection and subsequent clustering approach. Further, we developed two types of controllers to operate articulated objects: the first controller is model-free and incrementally opens articulated models. The second controller is model-based and estimates both the kinematic structure and the kinematic parameters. Finally, we store the inferred articulation models into our knowledge processing system KnowRob readily available for later interactions. All software components have been tested on two PR2 (Personal Robot 2) robots located at TUM and Bosch and are freely available on ros.org.},

	abstract = {We create a unified framework for analyzing and synthesizing plans  with loops for solving problems with non-deterministic numeric  effects and a limited form of partial observability.  Three  different action models---with deterministic, qualitative  non-deterministic and Boolean non-deterministic semantics---are  handled using a single abstract representation.  We establish the  conditions under which the correctness and termination of solutions,  represented as abstract policies, can be verified.  We also examine  the feasibility of learning abstract policies from examples.  We  demonstrate our techniques on several planning problems and show  that they apply to challenging real-world tasks such as doing the  laundry with a PR2 robot.  These results resolve a number of open  questions about planning with loops and facilitate the development  of new algorithms and applications.},

We argue that technology, design and user experience have to match to create a robot that will blend not only visually, but also emotionally into the scenarios it will be used for. We describe the requirement priorities, design decisions and technical feasibility with which Care-O-bot 4 is able to fulfill tasks in human environments and additionally evokes positive emotions and thus furthering and enhancing human-robot interaction (HRI)},
