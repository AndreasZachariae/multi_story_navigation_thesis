The main contributions of this thesis are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel hierarchical planner for multi-story navigation in arbitrarily large environments
    \item A novel 2D planner which is able to generate straight, deterministic and human-predictable paths.
    \item A new metric to measure the disturbance of a path on shared human-robot spaces.
    \item A comparative analysis of different planners in respect to the proposed metric.
    \item A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed planner using realistic simulation scenarios.
    \item A proof-of-concept implementation of the planner on a real robot using \gls{ros_2} and \gls{bt}.
\end{itemize}

While the developed 2D planner is extensively evaluated in a simple 2D environment, the hierarchical planner is tested in a 3D simulation with a realistic environment.
