I would like to thank my mentors Prof. Dr.-Ing. habil. Bj√∂rn Hein and Dr. Ilshat Mamaev for the time and effort they provided throughout the thesis. Their useful advice and suggestions were very helpful in finding the right focus. I would also like to thank Frederik, who helped me a lot in the final stages by taking over other tasks. Finally, I'm extremely grateful to Charlotte for her continuous support and patience. She always made me laugh and forget about work. 

Thank you all!
