Questions to ask:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What effect/contribution does your result have?
    \item What limitations does your work have?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Limitations
    \item Not optimal paths
    \item Use-cases
\end{enumerate}

Additionally the proposed straight roadmap on the lowest level allows for efficient replanning. This is theoretically possible, but the process of live map updates and caching of room segmentations is not implemented. But the existing roadmap does not have to be raplanned all the time from the ground up and can be resued for all path queries.
