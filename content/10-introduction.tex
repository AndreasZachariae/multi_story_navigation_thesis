    \item How is the following work structured?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Problems in mobile robotics
    \item General field of path planning
    \item Hierarchical Graphs
    \item Research question: How to plan in a multi-story environment? And how to drive in public spaces with service robots?
    \item Significance: Many use cases in public spaces in large hierarchical environments like hospitals.
    \item Development of a global planner plugin for straight and predictable paths in multi-story environments.
    \item Structure of the thesis
\end{enumerate}

Resarch questions:\\
1. How to navigate in large multi-story environments?\\
2. How to plan paths that are straight, deterministic and human-predictable?\\
